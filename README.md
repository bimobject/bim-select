# bim-select

A searchable dropdown/select angular component that handles millions of items
with the help of [virtual scrolling][vsr].

## Draft version

This first version is just extracted from an internal project at [BIMobject][bim]
and is in dire need to get some documentation and a better README file. For now,
please consult the JSDoc block in the implementation file.

There are currently too many runtime dependencies, the goal is to remove them
or make them optional.
